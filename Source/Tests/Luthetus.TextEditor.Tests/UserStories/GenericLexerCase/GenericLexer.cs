/// <summary>
/// User Story: A student of a university is learning about compilers. He wishes
/// to write his own programming language, but finds reading the code of his language
/// difficult because there is no color coding. It is all just black text on a white background.
/// The student just is looking for the "generic" lexing. Such that, he can provide
/// the syntax for his programming language, and receive syntax highlighting of
/// keywords, strings, and comments. The semantic syntax highlighting
/// he does not need.
/// <br/><br/>
/// Scope of what is intended to be tested: "Lexing" logic
/// </summary>
public class GenericLexer
{
    // One does not need to write so many lexers. Just write one generic one
    // for syntactic highlighting then add on
    // semantic lexing after the generic lexer finishes where its possible.
